# Constant Trigonometric Functions

This header-only library recursively computes the Taylor Series expansions for sine and cosine (and derives tangent) using C++ template metaprogramming. Note this is deprecated with [constexpr](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn956974.aspx) starting in C++11.

## Usage

There are two caveats with this library that ugly up the syntax more than a normal template metaprogram (yeah):
1. The current C++ standard (ยง14.3) at this time does not support floating point template arguments. As such, to use this library you need to wrap any input in container structs like the one in the example:
```
struct var
{
    static const long double value;
};

//M_PI is from the cmath library included earlier
const long double var::value = M_PI / 4;
```
2. You need to specify the recursion depth when initially calling the expansions. A recursion depth of 8 gives pretty decent accuracy without breaking my computer. The expansions are very computationally expensive and will anger the compiler if a maximum depth is exceeded. I'm not sure how to change the maximum recursion depth *in the compilation stage*, but if that was possible that would allow you to go even higher.

Note that a recursion depth ```n``` corresponds to an ```2n-1``` degree expansion, so using the [Lagrange error bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem) we can demonstrate that a recursion depth of 8 will have a margin of error ~~equal to..~~ that is very small.
